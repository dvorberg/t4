"""
This datasouce module uses the Python-only, filesystem based SQL
backend called gadfly by Aaron Watters, currently maintained by
Richard Jones <richard@users.sf.net>. It is available at
                                           U{http://gadfly.sourceforge.net}

This database adapter is fully useable with orm, though probably not
very usefull except for testing purposes.
